## Rubric (integer score 1–4)

Score **4**: Fully answers **all** aspects of the query with necessary detail (e.g., identifies the pest, provides mechanical control, and lists chemical dosages).

Score **3**: Answers the **main** question but leaves out a **minor** detail (e.g., mentions the pesticide but forgets the water dilution ratio).
**Also Score 3**: The bot explicitly acknowledges a **technical failure or service unavailability** (e.g., "I'm unable to fetch your PM-Kisan status right now due to a technical issue") AND provides meaningful next steps or alternatives — try again later, use the portal directly, call the helpline, etc. An honest graceful-failure response is not a wrong answer.

Score **2**: Provides a **partial** answer or answers something related to the crop but **not** answering the actual question.

Score **1**: The response is **incorrect**, talks about a **different** scheme/crop/topic than what was asked, or gives a vague deflection with no useful guidance whatsoever.
